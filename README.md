Password Complexity Checker.
Password strength is a measure of how resistant a password is to guessing or cracking, typically based on its length, complexity, and unpredictability. A strong password is more secure because it is harder for attackers to crack using methods like brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks.
Password Strength' refers to the level of security provided by a password, determined by factors such as the length of the password, the character set used, and the total possible combinations. The more possible combinations there are, the harder it is for the password to be cracked.

Password strength checkers are tools that evaluate how strong a password is based on certain criteria, helping users create more secure passwords. They assess factors like length, character type, and sequence patterns to determine how easily a password could be cracked. This information is used to guide users in improving the security of their online accounts.

1. Assessing Password Strength:
They analyze the password based on its length, complexity, and the use of various character types (letters, numbers, symbols).
They help determine how long it might take to crack the password using brute force attacks or other common methods.

2. Guiding Password Creation:
They provide real-time feedback to users, indicating whether the password is weak, moderate, or strong.
They suggest improvements, such as adding more characters, using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, including numbers and symbols, and avoiding sequential patterns.

3. Preventing Unauthorized Access:
By using password strength checkers, users can create more secure passwords, which reduces the risk of their accounts being compromised by hackers.
Strong passwords, combined with other security measures, can significantly enhance overall online security.

4. Educational Tool:
They can be used as a tool to educate users about what makes a strong password and why it's important.
By understanding the criteria used by password strength checkers, users can make informed decisions about their password choices.
